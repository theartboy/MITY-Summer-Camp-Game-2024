# MITY-Summer-Camp-Game-2024
This simple game was created during a game design course for middle schoolers.
During our two week camp the students designed and coded this game.
Some of the code files such as the map and utilities were provided to speed the process.
The core main file, player, teacher, and principal were developed in course.
